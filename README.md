# Wave Function Collapse Test

I created a very simple version of the code from https://github.com/robert/wavefunction-collapse, after watching some videos.
Expect many bugs.

## Running

Use this command:
`./main < input.txt`

input.txt has a format to follow

First, it has two numbers, n and m
`5 5`
Then, there is a single number k
`5`
which tells the code how many images to show. 
Finally, there is a matrix n tiles high and m tiles long, which can have any characters you like.

A sample is input.txt.
